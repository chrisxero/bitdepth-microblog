				"content_html": "<p>I love having smart lights in my home and keep adding more. I like the Trådfri system from IKEA which takes a different approach from that of the Philips Hue and Apple HomeKit compatible devices which use codes to add things to your system. With the Trådfri gateway you have to use a &ldquo;steering device&rdquo;, usually a wireless remote, to add things to the system by holding down a button. The light blinks a few times and the device is added to the system and the remote. That&rsquo;s how I set up all of the lights I got from IKEA.</p>\n\n<p>I just have one remote which I use in the kitchen to turn on the counter lights and ceiling light. I recently added a control outlet so I could plug in a string of lights and control them with my phone or Siri. I added it to the system, but it added it to the remote I use for the kitchen, so the string of lights in two room would come on when I turned on the lights with the switch in the kitchen. I searched and couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to disconnect one device from the remote.</p>\n\n<p>As I was talking with IKEA support on the phone and was waiting, I figured it out. You have to disconnect the remote from the system and then reconnect the remote to the room or lights that you want it to control. After you use the remote to add something to your gateway it will stay there whether the remote is connected or not. It&rsquo;s not very intuitive, but in figuring it out it did make me realize more of how their system with remotes work.</p>\n\n<p>With the smart lighting and switches from IKEA you don&rsquo;t need to have a gateway if you have a remote. So you can control the lights with only a remote control. So if you want two or three lights to be controlled by the same remote you just hold the remote close to the device and press the pairing button until the light blinks and it&rsquo;s paired. If you have a more complex system with a gateway as I do, the better way to pair the remote with multiple lights is to connect it to a room. So with the remote I use in the kitchen I connected the remote to the kitchen instead of the three separate lights in that room. Before I was connecting the remote to each of the lights until I had all three connected. But using the app and connecting devices that way can simplify the setup of a complicated system.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>It&rsquo;s fun to go to a film festival as it&rsquo;s an immersive and at times overwhelming experience seeing films with an appreciative audience in a condensed amount of time. Every year I prepare and hone the way that I get ready to dive into the experience to make sure that I am healthy, safe, and able to remember what I have seen.</p>\n\n<p>Here is what I&rsquo;m doing this year to get ready. At first I go on the website of the festival and go through all of the films and create a list on <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com\">Letterboxd</a>. I also copy the information about the film and create a document in <a href=\"http://www.bear-writer.com\">Bear</a> for each day. Having the descriptions and credits make it possible even to check on information about a film even when I don&rsquo;t have wifi or data. It is also very useful to make sure the spelling of a name or title of a film is correct. The third thing is do with the data about the film is create a calendar entry using <a href=\"https://flexibits.com/fantastical\">Fantastical</a> in a new calendar that I create that has the full program listing of the festival. That way I have all of the films listed even if I can&rsquo;t get online.</p>\n\n<p>With the Letterboxd lists, the documents in Bear, and the calendar I then can start figuring out what I want to see. I&rsquo;ll go through day by day and see what is playing and see if I recognize the director or the actor and do a bit of research. If it looks interesting I&rsquo;ll duplicate the calendar entry and add it to my calendar. That&rsquo;s how I make up the schedule of what I will potentially see. Then the potential conflicts show up with films playing at the same time or a film that will run into the start time of another film. Before the festival starts I will have a full schedule in my calendar with things to see every day.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge with making up a schedule in advance is that sometimes you&rsquo;ll be tired or not in the mood for the type of film you have chosen for that slot. So sometimes I&rsquo;ll wrap it all up early or will change to something else. All of the films that are in a festival have been chosen, so there are always interesting things to see. So sometimes I change at the last minute based on my mood or what someone may mention to me. Those are wonderful moments as you may discover a film that you never heard about or know nothing about.</p>\n\n<p>The other calculus that happens is to figure out what will be easier to see later and what will be more challenging. So I can skip the films that have a broader release scheduled and see the more obscure films. The other factor is having time to eat. So I will make sure that I have some granola bars in my bag and keep filling my water bottle. I&rsquo;ll bring my lunch as much as possible and have my Starbucks card full so I can quickly order a snack or coffee as I&rsquo;m leaving the theatre.</p>\n\n<p>To keep track of what I&rsquo;ve seen I&rsquo;ll take notes in Bear or in a <a href=\"https://fieldnotesbrand.com\">Field Notes</a> notebook that I carry with me. I&rsquo;ll log the film on Letterboxd with a capsule review and add it to a list of all of the films I&rsquo;ve seen at the festival and log it in <a href=\"http://getdrafts.com\">Drafts</a> in a document that has all of the films I&rsquo;ve seen as well. Then after the festival I&rsquo;ll go through my lists and create another list of my favourite films of the festival.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a bunch of work to get things set up, but it gets me ready and thinking about all of the details of the films and it helps me keep track of what I&rsquo;ve seen (and what I need to see if I&rsquo;ve missed something).

				"content_html": "<h2 id=\"howiposttomicro.blog\">How I Post to Micro.blog</h2>\n\n<p>For some reason I spend a lot of time thinking about what to post where online. I have my main blog at <a href=\"http://bitdepth.org\">bitdepth.org</a> where I post longer things that I write, but I don&#8217;t automatically have that feed showing up on micro.blog, but do a short post about my other post. Using <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/bitdepth/\">Letterboxd</a> I write capsule reviews of films and that feed goes into my Micro.blog stream. On Twitter I post more casual things and interact with people and a lot of what I post there is cross-posted automatically from micro.blog.</p>\n\n<p>While I try to keep things simple, it inevitably gets complicated. Until you start to describe how you do something, it becomes clear how idiosyncratic what you do can be. So here is how I post things to micro.blog using my iPhone and my MacBook Pro:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Every day I try to post at least one photo. Micro.blog has replaced Instagram for me. Initially I was trying to get some of the daily pins so I just kept going with posting something each day. I take photos with my iPhone using the excellent <a href=\"http://obscura.camera\">Obscura 2</a> app with the grid set to square to allow me to crop the photos. Sometimes I&#8217;ll add a filter in Obscura 2. Then it’s over to <a href=\"http://sunlit.io\">Sunlit</a> to choose the photo and crop it. Sometimes I&#8217;ll apply a filter in Sunlit or do some minor adjustments and then I post to Micro.blog using Sunlit. For photos I only post them from my iPhone.</li>\n<li>For original things for Micro.blog I usually will post using the iOS app on my iPhone or the MacOS app.</li>\n<li>If I&#8217;m about to watch a film, I reach for my iPhone, find the film in the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/apps/\">Letterboxd app</a>, and copy the Letterboxd link. Then in <a href=\"http://getdrafts.com\">Drafts</a> I write my post about the film that I am about to watch and include the name. I select the name and use some of the actions from the Extended Keyboard to make the name of the film all uppercase and then insert the link to the film on Letterboxd.

				"content_text": "<h2 id=\"howiposttomicro.blog\">How I Post to Micro.blog</h2>\n\n<p>For some reason I spend a lot of time thinking about what to post where online. I have my main blog at <a href=\"http://bitdepth.org\">bitdepth.org</a> where I post longer things that I write, but I don&#8217;t automatically have that feed showing up on micro.blog, but do a short post about my other post. Using <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/bitdepth/\">Letterboxd</a> I write capsule reviews of films and that feed goes into my Micro.blog stream. On Twitter I post more casual things and interact with people and a lot of what I post there is cross-posted automatically from micro.blog.</p>\n\n<p>While I try to keep things simple, it inevitably gets complicated. Until you start to describe how you do something, it becomes clear how idiosyncratic what you do can be. So here is how I post things to micro.blog using my iPhone and my MacBook Pro:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Every day I try to post at least one photo. Micro.blog has replaced Instagram for me. Initially I was trying to get some of the daily pins so I just kept going with posting something each day. I take photos with my iPhone using the excellent <a href=\"http://obscura.camera\">Obscura 2</a> app with the grid set to square to allow me to crop the photos. Sometimes I&#8217;ll add a filter in Obscura 2. Then it’s over to <a href=\"http://sunlit.io\">Sunlit</a> to choose the photo and crop it. Sometimes I&#8217;ll apply a filter in Sunlit or do some minor adjustments and then I post to Micro.blog using Sunlit. For photos I only post them from my iPhone.</li>\n<li>For original things for Micro.blog I usually will post using the iOS app on my iPhone or the MacOS app.</li>\n<li>If I&#8217;m about to watch a film, I reach for my iPhone, find the film in the <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/apps/\">Letterboxd app</a>, and copy the Letterboxd link. Then in <a href=\"http://getdrafts.com\">Drafts</a> I write my post about the film that I am about to watch and include the name. I select the name and use some of the actions from the Extended Keyboard to make the name of the film all uppercase and then insert the link to the film on Letterboxd. Then I use the Post to Micro.blog action to post it on Micro.blog.</li>\n<li>If I find a quote that I want to share on my Mac I will use the “Send to <a href=\"https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/\">MarsEdit</a>” button in Safari to open it up preformatted for posting to Micro.blog using Markdown. My <a href=\"http://bitdepth.tumblr.com\">old tumblelog</a> on Tumblr was where I would post inspiration and quotes and images from films. Now I post inspirational quotes to Micro.blog, but for images from films I&#8217;m thinking that I should keep only my own images on my main Micro.blog hosted site. I don&#8217;t want to import my old Tumblr blog, but I do want to repost some of the screenshots and add more.

Logging things and writing a bit about them can help me remember the film and it also makes it possible to compile all sorts of interesting statistics about the films you watch.

Here is how I added my Letterboxd updates to my microblog.</p>\n\n<p>First you need to find the RSS or JSON feed on the site where you want to pull content from. On Letterboxd the RSS feed is located quite logically at <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/username/rss/\">letterboxd.com/username/&hellip;</a> . (For me it is at letterboxd.com/bitdepth/rss/ as my username is bitdepth.) Copy that URL and go to your micro.blog “Account” page and then below the personal information you&rsquo;ll see your Feeds listed. Click on the &ldquo;Feeds &amp; Cross-posting&rdquo; button and in the &ldquo;Feed URL:&rdquo; box paste the feed URL. Click on the &ldquo;Add feed&rdquo; button and the next time the feed updates it will create a new micro.blog post.</p>\n\n<p>With the Letterboxd feed it will add an update whenever you log films or create lists. If you log a film and then later review it, there will be two entries created. (I tend to log films and then a day or two later write up a short review.) Whether you have a review or not, if you&rsquo;ve logged a film it will show up as a link on micro.blog and it includes the name of the film, the year, your star rating and then the link to the Letterboxd page for your rating (and review if you wrote one).</p>\n\n<p>What I like about the way that micro.blog handles this is that the content from the feed will show up for people following you within micro.blog, but not on your blog itself. When I first was considering this I was worried that I flood my blog with a series of updates about films, but it just shows up in the stream of micro.blog followers and not on my main site. This same approach can work with other sites that have a feed too.</p>\n\n<p>While Letterboxd has an API that is in beta, they don&rsquo;t allow you to select or create feeds based on certain tags or just of your Diary or Lists. While the RSS feed from Letterboxd in an RSS reader will include the body of a review, it doesn&rsquo;t get imported to micro.blog. One possible future project for me is to create a Workflow or IFTTT recipe to slightly change the process to post the review along with the title, year, rating, and link to the film as I think it would be nice to have the review appear in my feed as well.</p>\n",
