This allows me to have 27 plants growing at a time.</p>\n\n<p>The system is built around pods that are filled with a mix of soil, fertilizer, and seeds. You purchase the pods and put them in the sytem and then add water. As you start growing you put a small plastic dome over the top of the pod until it sprouts and the plant starts to touch the dome.

So I made sure to plug it in first thing in the morning when I got up and now it&rsquo;s synchronized with my day.
